# [Augmented Reality Workshop](https://www.meetup.com/Edmonton-NET-User-Group/events/250788193/)
## Jason Brown, Brent Housen, Kyle Hayward - July 26th, 2018

### Abstract
AR and VR technology is rapidly becoming the new way we interact with computers. Given that it's a whole new paradigm for developing applications, it can be daunting to get started. Come join us (Brent, Kyle, and Jason from Scope AR) for a crash course in getting started with mixed reality development with Unity and the Microsoft HoloLens. We'll cover setting up a HoloLens project, Unity engine basics, and building a simple game that interacts with the real world. Whether you're interested in game development, mixed reality/XR/AR, or just cool new technology, there's probably something here for you.

As for software, we'll require Windows 10 with at least the 2017 Fall Creator's update and Unity 2017 dot 3 dot 0f3 with Windows Store (.NET) build support and Visual Studio. Here's a link to the download wizard: https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download?thank-you=update&download_nid=49747&os=Win
